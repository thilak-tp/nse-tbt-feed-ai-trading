# NSE CM MTBT Feed Analysis using Feed Simuation and LLMs to predict market trends 
This repo consists of my effort on making a simulation of the NSE MTBT CM Feed by simulating an NSE Market Data Server sending the feed and an application that has the client to capture the feed and then efficiently handle it as well has use LLMs to predict the trend and choose whether to sell buy or hold.
The focus here would be the following:
- Low Latency
- Parallelism and Concurrency
- Object Oriented Programming
- Memory Safety
- Lock Free Programming
- High Performance Computing
